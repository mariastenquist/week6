MVC ---Architecture Pattern
Model - View -Controller

Models		-Represent our data (in Angular: services/factories)
Views		-What the client sees (in Angular: rendered HTML)
Controllers	-Glue between the Models/Views (in Angular: controller functions)


$scope: object that allows us to add properties to it {{greeting}} and use this in our html.

In Angular: services and factories--represent data, hold object constructors. This represents the Model. This is where the data lives. 

$http (in Angular): allows us to send/receive requests from server without refreshing the page.

AJAX: asynchronous Javascript and XML. 

AJAJ: asynchronous Javascript and JSON. So, basically AJAX. Less sexy.
